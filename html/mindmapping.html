<h1>Mind Mapping</h1>

<h2>Who is this for?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>This is for anyone who is trying to create new ideas or tie ideas together in a different way</li>
	<li>It can be for someone who wants to take notes in a new way</li>
</ul>

<h2>Works best when...</h2>


<h2>Maybe not for you IF...</h2>

<h2>Who's involved?  How long?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Really a singular activity, but can be facilitated in any size group</li>
	<li>Timebox yourself, name your time</li>
</ul>

<h2>Materials you will need</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Unlined paper</li>
	<li>Pencils (pens are harder)</li>
	<li>Colored pencils, if desired</li>
	<li>A timer</li>
	<li>A topic you want to explore</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why mindmapping?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>If you want to find a way to better remember the notes that are taken</li>
	<li>Understand something on a deeper level than you do right now</li>
	<li>It can link together disparate ideas in unique ways</li>
</ul>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

<p>
	Really, there are just a few simple rules, and then some best practices that can help you later on. 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Start with a central idea</li>
	<li>Add branches to your map, or start writing ideas, grouping similar ideas togther and your branches will come together logically</li>
	<li>Add keywords to your branches</li>
	<li>Color code your branches</li>
	<li>Include images whenever possible and appropriate, they can convey so much more meaning than the written word.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Some best practices might include the following:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Place the sheet of paper horizontally in front of you</li>
	<li>Draw a reasonably-sized memorable central image that represents what you are mapping out</li>
	<li>Use colors throughout, it draws in a different part of your brain</li>
	<li>Use one key word per line (or branch)</li>
	<li>Keep it organized, there's nothing wrong with redrawing a map if you find a part is becoming too cluttered</li>
	<li>Use emphasis to show associations in your mindmap</li>
	<li>Images can represent words in a metaphorical, sound-like, or in a direct manner</li>
	<li>You can create boundaries and borders to highlight certain areas of hte map.</li>
	<li>You can use different font styles to separate ideas and topics</li>
	<li>Branch endings can be varried to emphasize words or phrases</li>
	<li>Vary image colors, emphasis, and size to enhance memory and recall</li>
</ul>


<h2>Pitfalls to avoid</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Self-editing is one of the worst things you can do as you perform these creative processes.  Use pens, and if you feel something really doesn't belong just put a single line through it.</li>
	<li>Don't feel like your first draft will be your only draft.  It may help to redraw them as your understanding of a piece expands.</li>
	<li>Don't be afraid to use a "parking lot" section for pieces where you aren't sure where they belong yet.  </li>
	<li>Using computer software exclusively.  There is something in drawing/writing out ideas for most people that helps cement the ideas in our heads.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Helpful to understand</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Visual maps don't require the use of images to effectively convey information.  They can be built around key words and phrases in a similar fashion.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Big wins</h2>
