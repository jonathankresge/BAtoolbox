<h1>Three-minue critiques</h1>

<h2>Who is this for?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>This is to get a quick understanding of each person's presentation, typically done on an iterative fashion when developing ideas.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Works best when...</h2>
<ul>
	<li>You have everyone available in the same room</li>
</ul>

<h2>Maybe not for you IF...</h2>

<h2>Who's involved?  How long?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>4-12 people</li>
	<li>The whole team</li>
	<li>Plan on 5 minutes per critique, unless your team is really good at timeboxing things</li>
</ul>

<h2>Materials you will need</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The presentation materials that people have already created.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why the three-minute critique?</h2>
<p>
	This is a great way to get a shared understanding of multiple projects at the same time.  
</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>
	Each person has 3 minutes to get up and tell about their presentation, whether it be a <a href="crazyeights.html">Crazy Eight</a> or <a href="storyboarding.html">Storyboard</a>.  They should be timeboxed in that time, but it is a soft stop at the end instead of a hard stop.  At the end of the presentation of their material, the group can as any clarifying question to fully understand what the presenter is trying to accomplish.  
</p>
<p>
	Generally, the better presentations are the ones where the presenter stayed within thier timebox but also was able to get their point across with fewer questions.  
</p>
<h3>An alternative method</h3>
<p>
	Another way to do this is to gather everyone around a storyboard or whatever you are critiquing.  This works best when people have had a few minutes to review each of the designs that they will be critiquing.  Start the timer and have people tell what they really liked about the design, presentation, or object being critiqued.  Keep this positive, negative comments have no place being here.  At the end of the three minutes, as the person who drew/designed the piece if there was anything that the group missed from her presentation.  
</p>
<p>
	If a larger team has been assembled, then it may be more convenient to photograph the material to be critiqued and display it on a projector to get feedback.  This is a good option if you wanted to photograph everything anyway, but be aware that this could take a few minutes and start sucking the energy out of the meeting while participants wait for this work to be done.  
</p>

<h2>Pitfalls to avoid</h2>
<ul>
	<li>This is all about understanding the full picture of what a person is presenting, critical feedback does not belong here.</li>
	<li>Keep opinions of a person's design to yourself, this is about understanding their concept.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Helpful to understand</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Since this is about understanding, please ensure questions are specific:
	<ul>
		<li>I don't understand <i>that part</i> of the drawing, can you be more specific?</li>
		<li>Can you please explain what you meant about how this feature addresses the persona's problems?</li>
	</ul></li>

</ul>

<h2>Big wins</h2>
