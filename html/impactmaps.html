<h1>Impact Mapping</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>
	The purpose of impact mapping is to visualize teh scope and underlying assumptions, created collaboratively by senior technical and business people.  It is a mind-map grown during a discussion facilitated by considering the following four aspects:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Goal - The center of an impact map answers the most important question:  Why are we doing this?</li>
	<li>Actors - The first branch of an impact map provides answers to the the following questions (these are the actors):</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Who can produce the desired effect?</li>
		<li>Who can obstruct it?</li>
		<li>Who are the consumers or users of our products and services?</li>
		<li>Who will be impacted by it?</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Impacts:  The second-level branch of an impact map sets the actors in the perspective of the business goal.  It answers the follwing questions (these are the impacts we are trying to create):</li>
	<ul>
		<li>How should our actor's behavior change?</li>
		<li>How can they help us to achieve our goals?</li>
		<li>How can they obstruct or prevent us from succeeding?</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Deliverables - Once we have the first three levels, we can talk about scope.  This branch answers the following questions (these are the deliverables, features, and organizational activities):  </li>
	<ul>
		<li>What can we do, as an organization, to support the required impacts?</li>
		<li>What can we do, as a delivery team, to support the required impacts?</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Problem solving with impact maps</h2>

<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>
	As you work from left to right (starting on the left with the goal), we always want to start out with the why.  Perhaps we should start by using the "5 Whys Method" to understand the root cause of what we are doing to make sure that we really understand the goal at hand, the underlying problem we are trying to fix.  We would not want to start with a symptom of a problem instead of the problem itself.  
</p>

<h3>Who</h3>
<p>
	The next step in achievinv our goal is to think about who this change will impact.  We typicaly start wtih the most influential persona at the top.  Think about people ho you don't usually think to collaborate with that may be involved.  Invite people of diverse backgrounds when you think of the who, because the more insights you have on this the better your end result should be.  We need to list everyone that will be impacted by this goal being achieved, wehther they will be helped by this change or hindered.
</p>

<h3>What?</h3>
<p>
	
</p>

<h3>How?</h3>
<p>
	We want to understand "what we can do to support this change," or in other words what changes (whether good or bad) will take place for this persona as a result of us achieving our goal. These are the deliverables that could be used.  Some examples could be training document used for support, the software that is delivered to the customer, or the back-end support needed to make this goal more realistic.  In the end, this is reall the least important part of this exercise.  We need to understand how our goal will effect those who use the system, and if that is the effect we want to achieve.  This piece is the icing on the cake.
