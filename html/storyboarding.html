<h1>Storyboarding</h1>


<h2>Who is this for?</h2>
<p>
	Storyboarding helps teams explore and communicate possible solutions or iterations for a current product/problem/dilemma.  It helps the audience to visually engage iwth the story of the user interfacing with our software to create an emotional response to walk away with.  it is to created a shared sense of the experience we are trying to provide to the persona.  
</p>

<h2>Works best when...</h2>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>You need a new way to look at the problem</li>
		<li>The potential solutions are proving difficult to communicate.</li>
		<li>The persona affected by the problem is clearly defined and the pain-points are understood.</li>
		<li>The problem is known and defined, but an obvious solution just isn't there.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h2>Maybe not for you IF....</h2>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>The solution already exists, and there is a shared agreement around the solution.</li>
		<li>When a shared sense of urgency already exists to create a solution</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h2>Who's involved? How long? </h2>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>4-12 Players</li>
		<li>Include anyone involved with creating a solution to the problem</li>
		<li>30-45 minutes per round of storymapping and voting. Including the other activities listed below will add more time</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h2>Materials you will need</h2>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Pens, preferrably something thick enough it can be seen from several feet away (like sharpies/white board markers)</li>
		<li>Sticky notes, can be square or rectangular</li>
		<li>Paper, both to draw and to write on</li>
		<li>Tape to hang storyboards up</li>
		<li>Countdown timer that is visible anywhere in the room</li>

	</ul>
</p>

<h2>Why storyboarding</h2>
<p>
	"Storyboarding helps us link our facts and ideas with an audience's experiences and emotions" (Holland).  It can provide a far more engaging experience for an audience than simple words and descriptions alone.  As such, it can help created a shared understanding far faster.  And don't forget, not everyone learns or can process things aurally, some people just need to see something in action before they can get bought into a solution.  This helps those visual people understand 
</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

<p>
	Yes, storyboarding can be done by everyone, even those who cannot draw.  You know, my stick figures are pretty good, better watch out!  This is often a complaint by people who are introduced to this technique, but a storyboard for creating a solution can be as simple as stick figures with some boxes and words (thought bubbles).  If you are using it to communicate, there are ways you can draw a storyboard with very little skill.
</p>

<h3>Storyboarding as a communication technique</h3>
<p>
	Storyboarding has been used in the entertainment industry for years.  Johnny Holland says that Walt Disney was using storyboarding as early as the 1920s to convey their story clearly among those working on the movies.  Today, Pixar (according to Holland) uses storyboarding before even scriptwriting to ensure the theme and main ideas are kept in line as they are outlining their story.  So there is evidence that this can be used for a technique of communication.  
</p>
<p>
	So, are you using the storyboard to communicate a problem a persona is having with our products?  Are you trying to use the storyboard to communicate how the solution is to be developed?  Or are you using it to outline how a particular solution will impact a persona's journey with our products?  All of these are valid use of storyboarding for communication.
</p>

<h3>Storyboarding as ideation</h3>
<p>
	Storyboarding can also be used to quickly create potential solutions to a problem to find the best possible solution for a persona.  One quick trip through the journey is as follows:
	<ul>
		<li>Understanding the problem</li>
		<li>Mind mapping potential ideas</li>
		<li>Crazy eights</li>
		<li>Storyboarding</li>
		<li>Silent critiquing</li>
		<li>3-Minute critiques</li>
		<li>Voting for the winner (or winning pieces)</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
	We will focus on the storyboarding here, as the other techniques will be outlined elsewhere.  Any of these techniques can be repeated throughout this process to refine the solution your team comes up with.  Crazy eights are mentally tough the first time you do them, so repeating that technique once, or even twice, can yield positive results.
</p>

<p>
	So, back to storyboarding.  You will want to start with a sheet of paper or two and sticky notes.  The sticky notes will be your panels, that will be where you draw out your action.  This is where your persona will show up, if you choose to depict them in the action.  Otherwise, this is where you will rough out what you see on the screen.  Draw out only the necessary parts, roughing out everything else.  To the right of each sticky note, you will write out what is going on. 
</p>

<p>
	Once you have finished your storyboard, you need to keep several things in mind.  First, your storyboard should <em>NOT</em> have your name on it, when you do the next voting piece it should be anonymous (as much as possible in a smaller group).  Second, your storyboard needs to have a title at the top of it.  If you have multiple pieces of paper, make sure that they are taped together so they stay together.  
</p>

<p>
	Now that the storyboards are all created, it is time to hang them on the wall.  Make sure that they are hung so that there are at least 3-4 feet between them, because it's time to vote!  The space gives people a chance to wander around and browse the storyboards without feeling like they have to crowd around them.  
</p>

<p>
	As voting takes place, each person should vote on which storyboard, or which piece of a storyboard, they really liked.  Each voter will need some sticky circle dots or use markers to mark what they like.  If the person voting liked an entire board, then they should mark the top of the storyboard.  If they just liked a piece of the storyboard, then they should mark by the sticky note that they really liked.
</p>

<p>
	This is a great time to take a bio break (or break for the day on a multi-day event), so the facilitator can review the votes and bring the pieces voted on up to the group to discuss.  Once the group sees which pices everyone liked, then the facilitator may decide to do another round of storyboarding to flesh out the winners (or to find a way to put the winning pieces together).  Once the clear winners are in place, this exercise is over.  
</p>

<h3>Easing someone in</h3>
<p>
	There will always be one or two in every group who are so self-conscious of their ability to draw that this activity is not comfortable at all.  One way to draw them into the activity is to do this in stages. 
	<ul>
		<li>Have them write out what they would draw in each box, with arrows going from one box to the next</li>
		<li>Have them associate emotions with each box in their storyboard</li>
		<li>Have them imagine a camera is hovering over the scene they just drew, to include
		<ul>
			<li>Storyteller commentary - text that appears at the top of a frame to advance the narative</li>
			<li>Speech and thought bubbles</li>
			<li>Characters and scene</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Let them know come away leaving the audience without a doubt about the outcome of the story</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h2>Pitfalls to avoid</h2>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Your storyboard should not depend on other, unseen, pieces to make sense.  It will likely fit into a bigger pictuer, just make sure it makes sense where your storyboard fits into the big picture.</li>
		<li>Throwing away all of your work at the end of the exercise.  Keep your "winning" storyboard posted for others to see, or have someone redraw it to make it easy to collaborate on.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h2>Helpful tips to understand</h2>

<p>
	<ul>
		<li>The structure of a narative story, such as "Freytag's Pyramid" or the "Hero's Journey"</li>
		<li>What is the experience theme (or emotional driver) for the story that we are providing</li>

	</ul>
</p>
