<h1>Persona Development</h1>

<h2>Who is this for?</h2>
<p>
	For teams who want to empathize with our users.  A persona (according to Wikipedia) is a "fictional character created to represent the differnet user types that might use a site, brand, or product in a similar way."  Developing and understanding personas are great ways to really get into the minds of our users for a project.  
</p>

<h2>Works best when...</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Creating personas before trying to create a solution to a problem.  It can help create better brainstorming activities, use case specification, and feature definition.</li>
	<li>Needing to have a consistent definition of your user to be shared among stakeholders</li>
	<li>Conceptualizing a set of real users' goals, capabilities, and contexts for using your product/service</li>
	<li>Keeping the conern on the main set of users and not the edge cases when designing a solution</li>
	<li>You have data on your users from which to base your personas.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Maybe not for you IF...</h2>
<ul>
	<li>You are creating these yourself, these should be created in groups to prefent "self-referential design"</li>
	<li>You are not willing to validate your assertions with data about your product or service</li>
	<li>You are including users in the product development</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who's involved?  How long?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>2-12 people, the larger the group the better</li>
	<li>A group that has the best understanding of the user</li>
	<li>1-2 hours</li>
</ul>

<h2>Materials you will need</h2>

<h2>Why personas?</h2>
<p>
	Personas will ive you a quick way to figure out what is challenging a specific user type, what their goals are, and how comfortable they are achieving their goals (or what they would need to feel comfortable achieving their goals).  Usability.gov gives the following key beneifts to using personas:
	<ul>
		<li>Stakeholders and leaders evaluate new feature ideas in terms of what will help the persona</li>
		<li>Information architects can develop informed wireframe, infervace behaviors, and labeling</li>
		<li>Designers create the look and feel with a specific user segment in mind</li>
		<li>Systems engineers/developer decide can which approach to take based on behaviors of user personas</li>
		<li>Content authors can ensure the site content is geared towards the right audiences</li>
		<li>Leverages some innate human abilities:
		<ul>
			<li>The ability to create, share, and hear stories</li>
			<li>Storytelling can stimulate long-term memory which can bring more experience to bear on the problem</li>
			<li>People tend to relate better to real, tangible examples rather than extractions</li>
		</ul></li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h2>How to develop a persona?</h2>

<p>
	There will be three big things that we will want to answer in working on creating the persona.  The first is <em>What is the purpose of vision</em> of the product or service in question.  <em>Describe the user</em> on a personal, professional, and technical level.  Describe the <em>user's motivation and goals</em>.
</p>

<p>
	There are some best practices for creating personas:
	<ol>
		<li><em>Conduct your <a href="customerInterviews.html">user research</a></em> to answer who your users are; why they are using the system; and what their behaviors, assumptions, and expectations are for your system.</li>
		<li>Find themes in your research taht are specific, relevant, and universal to the users</li>
		<li>Organize the elements into persona groups (or archetypes) that represent your target users</li>
		<li>Combine and prioritize the personas into primary, secondary, and, if necessary, users who you do not want using your system (anti-personas)</li>
		<li>Develop descriptions around them including a background, motivations, and expectations.  The best personas have a photograph to visually represent this persona.</li>
	</ol>
</p>

<p>
	We should keep in mind that there are three two where this persona interacts with our products and services.  We need to understand what this persona's end goals will be.  Is it setting up a blog to keep in touch with friends and family or is it to make money by monetizing it?  Once we know what her end goal is, then we can ask what the scenario is where they will interact with our products or services to achieve that end goal.  In other words, why are they chosing us to achieve their goal and how are they interacting with us?  As we continue to use the persona, we will want to keep in mind how this personas emotional journey is impacted.  How can we help them be satisfied with our products or services instead of being frustrated by them?
</p>

<p>
	Here are several elements that should a part of almost every persona (<a href="persona-core-poster_creative-companion1.pdf">see this template as an example</a>):
	<ul>
		<li>Persona group (example, web developer)</li>
		<li>Fictional name</li>
		<li>Job titles and major responsibilities</li>
		<li>Demographic information (age, education, ethnicity, family status)</li>
		<li>Their goals and tasks associated with using your product/service</li>
		<li>Their physical, social, and technological environment</li>
		<li>A quote that sums up what matters most to them, as it relates to your product or service</li>
		<li>Their pain points associated with using your product or service</li>
		<li>What things the design MUST do to satisfy the user</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
	Remember that the important part of persona development is to "fully understand a user and then simply share the top-level information with others." (Goltz)  They were originally developed by Alan Cooper in the early 80's to do just that, and then help developers and designers empathize with the people who would eventually use the software.  These were developed as a way to share with consultants and stakeholders the information he already knew.  
</p>


<h2>Pitfalls to avoid</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Getting too specific with your persona could exclude larger portions of your user base</li>
	<li>Poorly designed personas will undermine the creditibility of all personas</li>
</ul>

<h2>Helpful to understand</h2>
<ul>
	<li>There is a difference between a design persona (which we are talking about here) and a marketing persona.
	<ul>
		<li>Marketing personas focus on demographics, buying motivations and concerns, shopping or buying preferences, marketing message, media habits, etc.</li>
		<li>Design personas focus user goals, current behavior, and pain points</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Big wins</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Your biggest win will come if you develop your persona at the beginning of a project.  This way the persona can influence the design and testing of the solution throughout implementationn.</li>
	<li>You shouldn't have more than 3-5 personas for any project.</li>
	<li>Keep in mind that it's not the one-page document that is important, it's the research and understanding that comes about this type of customer that is key.</li>
</ul>
