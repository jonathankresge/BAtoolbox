	<title>BA Toolbox - Value Proposition Canvas</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Value proposition panvas</h1>

<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>
	When looking at a value proposition canvas, we are looking at a subset of a typical business model.  We are looking specifically at a specific <a href="persona.html">persona</a>, as well as what products or services we offer to fit the need of that customer.  The goal of this tool is to help provide a good fit between the products and services that we offer (or potentially to identify what gaps exist in those products/services) and the personas we are targeting.  When you match the products/services to the peronas' needs, that is called a product-market fit (you match your products to the market demands).
</p>

<p>
	Each of the boxes should be force ranked with the most important piece at the top of the box.\
</p>

<p>
	It is simply an overview of what the persona wants and needs, and why the customer feels that way.  It can be a great first step, actual implementation of that product is a multi-disciplinary effort between UI/UX experts, architects, engineers, marketing, etc.  
</p>

<h2>The persona (on the right)</h2>

<h3>Persona jobs</h3>
<p>
	In the persona jobs box, you gather the needs of the persona, the problems that they are trying to solve, and the tasks that they are tryigng to perform or complete.  Remember that these tasks can be direct tasks (tasks that they are trying to do right now), indirect tasks (somethign they expect to happen as a result of their direct tasks), or emotional tasks (feeling good about using the product/service).  An immediate task could be uploading an existing website.  An indirect task could then be something like driving more customers to their store because of a website.  An emotional task coudl be feeling successful completing the jobs at hand.  It is also good to look at wht social jobs the persona is tryign to achieve, like looking good in the surrounding community.
</p>

<p>
	Some questions to ask yourself when you are working on this part of VPC:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>What functional jobs is the persona tryting to get done?  (perform a specific task, solve a specific problem, etc)</li>
	<li>What social jobs is the persona trying to get done?  (trying to look good, gain power, gain status, etc.)</li>
	<li>What emotional jobs is the persona trying to accomplish?  (aesthetics, feel good, security, etc.)</li>
	<li>What basic needs is your persona trying to satisfy?  (communication, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Persona pain points</h3>
<p>
	In this box, you will gather all of the negative emotions or undesired costs, situations, or risks that a persona could experiende before, during, or after getting their job done.  You should include any frustrations the persona could experience during this process.  Think about what costs are associated with the persona that they may find undesirable, what negative situations does this process put the persona through, and what risks does the persona potentially experience during this process.
</p>
<p>
	Some questions to ask yourself when you are working on this part of the VPC:

	<li>What risks does your persona fear?  (financial, social, technical risks, what could go wrong)</li>
	<li>What keeps your persona awake at night?  (big issues, concerns, worries, etc.)</li>
	<li>What common mistakes does your persona make?  (usage mistakes, etc.)</li>
	<li>What barriers are keeping your persona from adopting solutions?  (upfront investment costs, learning curve, resistance to change, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Persona gains</h3>

	In the persona gains box, you record all the beneifts and desires of a persona.  You also record personal, functional, or economic gains the persona is looking forward to.  Make sure that you include positive emotions, functional requirements, and/or cost savings the persona wants to receive.

<h2>Our products and services</h2>

<h3>Products and services</h3>
<p>
	Here is where you list the products and services that we offer that this value proposition is built around.  Things to keep in mind are the functional, social, or emotional status of hte persona.  This is what teh persona is going to use to solve his/her problems.
</p>

</ul>

<h3>Pain relievers</h3>
<p>
	In this box, you describe how the products and services that you list can help alleviate teh challenges, needs, and pains of the customer.  You need to describe how these products and services eliminate negative emotions, undesired costs, or <em>avoidable</em> situations.  You should look at how frequently this happens for our persona as we rank these potential solutions.  
</p>
<p>
	Ask if the products or services fill any of the following needs:
</p>
<ul>

	<li>Do they get rid of barriers that are keeping your persona from adopting solutions?  (lower or no upfront investment costs, flatter learning curve, less resistance to change, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gain creators</h3>
<p>
	Gain creators describe how the products or services add value to the customer.  When looking at these, we should ask the following questions:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Do they create savings that make your persona happy? (time, money, effort, etc.)</li>

	<li>Do they help make adoption easier?  (lower cost, less investments, lower risk, better quality, performance, design, etc.)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Remember, there are multiple products out there for customers</h2>
<p>
	For each persona you are looking at, it would be a good idea to perform this same analysis on competing products.  This way, you can identify ways to modify a product to better meet the needs of that persona.  If creating a new product, it would be a great idea to do this analysis first to see how the product could be marketed, designed, and created to fill in where other products lack.
