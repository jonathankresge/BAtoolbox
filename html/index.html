<h1>What is this?</h1>

I have put together this set of tools to help teams get unstuck when problems arise.  I will start out with just a few tools that I will have detailed and I will be adding to them weekly.  

<h2>Current tools in the toolbox</h2>

<p>
	All the tools in the toolbox will require an impartial facilitator to run the activities, unless otherwise stated.  I will list the average time it takes to use the tools next to the name below, but keep in mind that assumes that the group stays on task and the group has some experience with these tools in the past.  If either of these is lacking, please add extra time.  Also, if you would like a Business Analyst (BA) to facilitate the meeting for you, please just sent me a message with the details and I will try to arrange a time that works for everyone.  
</p>

<p>
	<a href="facilitation.html">Facilitation guidelines</a> can help ensure that whatever tool you choose, you will be more likely to have a successful experience with it.

<h2>Requirements Elicitation and Writing</h2>
<p>
	We are going to look at gathering requirements here.  We will be looking at the tools used in eliciting, validating, and verifying the software requriements for projects.  We will be looking at the following types of requirements:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Business requirements - the business rationale for moving forward with a project</li>
	<li>User requirements - the requirements from the user's point of view</li>
	<li>Software requirements - the detailed functional and nonfunctional requirements that must be met to meet the needs of the business and the user</li>
</ul>

<p>
	We will also be looking at functional requirements and nonfunctional requirements.  Functional requirements will be what the system has the capability to do:  the actions, tasks, and behaviors that will be required.  The nonfunctional requirements are the properties the system must have in place to make sure that the software solution works properly.
