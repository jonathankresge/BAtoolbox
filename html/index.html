	<h1>What is this?</h1>

	I have put together this set of tools to help teams get unstuck when problems arise.  I will start out with just a few tools that I will have detailed and I will be adding to them weekly.  

	<h2>Current tools in the toolbox</h2>

	<p>
		All the tools in the toolbox will require an impartial facilitator to run the activities, unless otherwise stated.  I will list the average time it takes to use the tools next to the name below, but keep in mind that assumes that the group stays on task and the group has some experience with these tools in the past.  If either of these is lacking, please add extra time.  Also, if you would like a Business Analyst (BA) to facilitate the meeting for you, please just sent me a message with the details and I will try to arrange a time that works for everyone.  
	</p>

	<p>
		<a href="facilitation.html">Facilitation guidelines</a> can help ensure that whatever tool you choose, you will be more likely to have a successful experience with it.

	<h2>Requirements Elicitation and Writing</h2>
	<p>
		We are going to look at gathering requirements here.  We will be looking at the tools used in eliciting, validating, and verifying the software requriements for projects.  We will be looking at the following types of requirements:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Business requirements - the business rationale for moving forward with a project</li>
		<li>User requirements - the requirements from the user's point of view</li>
		<li>Software requirements - the detailed functional and nonfunctional requirements that must be met to meet the needs of the business and the user</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		We will also be looking at functional requirements and nonfunctional requirements.  Functional requirements will be what the system has the capability to do:  the actions, tasks, and behaviors that will be required.  The nonfunctional requirements are the properties the system must have in place to make sure that the software solution works properly.

	<h2>Understanding yourself and others</h2>
	<p>
		This may sound a little strange, but you need to be able to understand yourself, how you work, your preferred style of communication, your preferred style of learning, your personality, etc.  If you can understand how you work on an intimate level, not just the superficial level that most people have an understanding of themselves, you can then have a much more thorough understanding of others.  This is crucial when you are trying to lead without having authority (as a BA, that happens....A LOT!), or you need to be seen as an authority on a subject and be treated as an expert, or you need to lead a change for your organization. 
	</p>
	<p>
		These soft skills are things that a lot of people in the work place skip out on because these topics aren't felt to be as important as subject knowledge or excellent performance.  But most key leaders have these skills in their back pocket that they can pull out at any time.  Those leaders are the ones that people tend to follow, admire, and learn from.  Below are some of the soft skills, with additional resources, that can help you be more successful at the above skills.
