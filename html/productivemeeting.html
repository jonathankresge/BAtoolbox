<h1>Holding productive meetings</h1>

<h2>Experiment</h2>
<p>
	For the next week, I want you to count the amount of time that you spend in meetings.  Start there, then come back to me and we'll do the next challenge.  Alright, I couldn't wait, next I want you to look around the room.  How many people are engaged in those meetings?  In reality, how many man-hours are wasted during your meetings (and I'm just talking about those people who are there only physically and occasionally mentally when they are asked a direct question)?  How many of your meetings this week ended up with no decisions of consequence being made in them and a follow up chat or meeting was needed to make that happen?
</p>
<p>
	So you can see why there is a need for more productive meetings!  Productive meetings can result in more productive employees, and better decisions being made across the company.  The more time you spend in meetings, the more crucial that they be effective and productive.
</p>

<h2>What can you improve?</h2>
<p>
	These tips come from all over the place, including the resources listed below.  I will put these in what I consider to be a priority order.
</p>

<!-- I want to make sure that I flesh out these paragraph descriptions as I go.  For now, it's just to get the ideas down.  -->

<ol>
	<li><b>Make your purpose known</b>
		<p>
			The meeting needs to have a clear, defined purpose.  You need to have a reason to get people together.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><b>Create and stick to a schedule</b>
		<p>
			To keep tangents from completely derailing you from the rest of your agenda items, stick to a schedule.  
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><b>Start and end on time</b>
		<p>
			If you expect people to be on time for your meetings and to take you seriously, it is critical that you start on time.  If someone comes in late, refrain from recapping what has happened in the meeting.  That gives the impression to everyone that it is acceptable to arrive late to a meeting.  If a key person is going to be late (and you know it ahead of time), or if you have someone habitually late, it is important to ask for notes/reports/comments ahead of time so that their contribution can be included in the meeting.  
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><b>Ban unneeded technology</b>
		<p>
			Do you really need to check Facebook or the news during a meeting?
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><b>Follow up from the meeting quickly</b>
		<p>
			To ensure a shared sense of understanding from the meeting, follow up shortly (within 24 hours at the most) with what was discussed and agreed upon, any responsibilities delegated or given out, and any assigned deadlines associated with them. 
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><b>Invite the right people to the meeting</b>
		<p>
			You need to have the people there who are responsible for making a decision or providing the right input.  
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><b>Luring people in with treats isn't necessarily a bad thing</b>
		<p>
			Consider long meetings, how they can drag on.  Refreshments can help provide a boost of energy (mental and physical) to keep things going.  
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><b>Lay the ground rules</b>
		<p>
			Everyone who comes into the meeting should know what to expect.  Whether that is setting the rules for your meeting or a company-wide set of ground rules, no one should be surprised by how a meeting is run. 
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><b>Give advanced notice as often as possible</b>
		<p>
			Context switching is hard for a lot of people....
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><b>Consider your meeting space</b>
		<p>
			Is it comfortable enough to accommodate everyone without drowning everyone out in too much space?  Can you see everyone?
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><b>Have an agenda ready and distributed ahead of time</b>
		<p>
			This gives people an awareness of what will be talked about, who will present or lead any discussion, and how long you have to make a decision.  Your agenda should have at least a one sentence description of the different items that your team will be discussing.  And getting your agenda out at least 24 hours ahead of time will give people a chance to give input into the meeting agenda or give people a chance to think about the topics to be discussed.  Asking people to come having thought about the agenda items will help the team have a more meaningful discussion once the meeting starts.  
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><b>Spend a small, set amount of time on catching up</b>
		<p>
			We all have very busy lives, and some of the time meetings are the times where we get to see the people we enjoy spending time with.  It is actually more efficient to plan for a few minutes at the beginning of the meeting catching up.  People need to build friendships at work, and if people don't arrive to the meetings early (where they could naturally chat) its a good idea to spend a few minutes catching up with everyone. 
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><b>Prioritize your agenda items</b>
		<p>
			Make sure that your most important agenda items are towards the beginning of the meeting so that if you run out of time (and since you're now ending on time), then you can be sure that you talked about the most important items of the meeting.  
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><b>Find a way to draw out the quiet ones</b>
		<p>
			This can be a hard thing to do sometimes.  Is it because they are distracted?  Hopefully some of the above suggestions will help with that.  Is it because they don't feel their views are valued?
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><b>Take the blame when it is deserved</b>
		<p>
			No one enjoys this, but if you are taking responsibility for a meeting and/or for a team, then you should be willing to accept responsibility (if deserved) instead of pushing it off on the team.  
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><b>Share the credit with the team</b>
		<p>
			Whenever the team does well, make sure that you are sharing credit with the team, because the team (as a whole) was the unit that did the work.  
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><b>Don't make anyone feel stupid in the meeting</b>
		<p>
			This may go without saying that it's not nice to do this, but it also sends a message that you don't want to hear any conflicting opinions.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><b>Keep regular meetings short and very structured</b>
		<p>
			****
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><b>Schedule regular breaks for longer meetings and stick to the schedule</b>
		<p>
			Some people need bio-breaks more regularly than others, and some just feel like they lose touch with the world so fast it's not even funny.  This lets the latter folks check in with the outside world to make sure they aren't missing anything crucial.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><b>Meetings should stay tightly focused</b>
		<p>
			Theoretical problems or side issues should not be discussed during the meeting, other meetings can be scheduled or conversations can be had outside if they fall outside the scope of the agenda/schedule.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><b>Assign roles during a meeting</b>
		<p>
			Assign someone specific to record what gets discussed, what gets agreed upon, any action items, and any due dates agreed upon during the meeting.  During the last five minutes of the meeting, review these items to make sure everyone is clear.  Some roles to use:  timekeeper, facilitator, recorder.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><b>It is positive to have a retrospective on your meeting</b>
		<p>
			We have retrospectives each sprint to see what we did well, what we can improve upon, and what we should start doing differently.  Why not at the end of a meeting, as well?
		</p>
