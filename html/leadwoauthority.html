<h1>Leading without authority</h1>

<h2>What does it mean to lead without authority?</h2>
<p>
	There are often times when a group must be led without anyone assigning (formal) authority to you.  What are the right ways to help lead or guide that group through a process or to make a decision.  Often, as a Business Analyst, you should be treated as a trusted advisor, whose opinion should be respected.  However, you may not be treated as such.  Here are some of the ways (though not always easy) that you can help to be seen as a leader and guide the team you are working with. 
</p>
<p>
	Leading without authority means that you have to be able to develop influence, and this is not something that will happen overnight.  It can be difficult to establish influence in certain environments.  Erica Hersh says that you can expand your circle of influence by "displaying qualities associated with leadership while building networks and relationship throughout your organization and others."  This is key, because you cannot easily influence people you do not already have a relationship with.  Hersh describes this as "an art and a skill." 
</p>

<h3>Two common challenges to leading outside of your hierarchy</h3>
<p>
	There are two main reasons (according to Hersh) that this is challenging in the work place.  The first is being siloed into your own functional group that it is difficult sometimes difficult to get out to network.   Networking and getting to know other people is the first step to being able to extend your influence, because the first step is establishing a relationship with people.  
</p>
<p>
	The second reason is the felt need to deal with urgent matters and ignore the longer-term goal of relationship building.  When deadlines get tight (which they often are), it is difficult to get around others that you don't already have an established relationship with.  Without the ability to network, it is very hard to establish relationships with others in the organization. 
</p>

<h2>Traits involved in gaining trust and influence with people</h2>
<p>
	Cuddy, et. al., discuss the psychology behind connecting with people before being able to lead them in any capacity, whether as a direct report or outside of our influence.  They discuss that psychological research shows that over 90% of the variance in our impressions (positive versus negative) come from two traits:  warmth and strength.  
</p>
<p>
	They go on to discuss that it is important to connect to people first, and that is the trait of warmth.  Lead with being able to connect with people.  WHen leading with warmth, you remove the potential for a leader to establish fear as a driving force for followers.  By leading with the warmth, you facilitate trust, communication, and the absorption of ideas.  This can be achieved by simple, yet genuine, acts like a smile or nodding your head to acknowledge that you have heard someone when they are speaking to you.  
</p>
<p>
	Strength is going to be defined as being competent in the workplace and having the right credentials.  It is a good thing to establish this, but when this is the first things that is established, then you can run the risk of "undermining cognitive potential, creativity, and problem solving."  Cuddy, et. al., calculated that there is a 1 in 2000 chance of being rated a good leader when running only through strength and ignoring warmth in leading people.  
</p>
<p>
	When we lead with strength, we generally don't feel the need to prove that we are trustworthy because we know our intentions and actions, despite that is something we look for in others.  If given the chance, we often will take training that involves competence-based skills for ourselves, but would prefer that others take soft-skills based training.  Generally, we feel that we need to demonstrate trust by being effective and efficient in our jobs and that other people's soft skills need to develop so that we can interact with them more easily. However, the most successful leaders focus on the soft skills and make up on the other side of the equation afterwards
</p>
<p>
	What is funny to me is that when we are asked to describe events that define our lives, we tend to describe competence-based events; however describing events in others, we focus on the warmth and generosity of others.  Research is fairly consistent with this observation, as explained by Cuddy, et. al.  Without the warmth, an organization can adopt the "every employee for herself" mentality, which is a big loss of morale and institutional strength.  This is even true when it involves investing our own money (without a promise of a return on investment):  we are more likely to invest in people who we feel are more trustworthy than others.  
</p>
<p>
	Trust, most importantly provides more opportunities to change people's attitudes, and that is then the key to influencing other people around you.  Trust is how you can get people to accept your message.  It can significantly increase "information sharing, openness, fluidity, and cooperation", as well as "the quantity or quality of the ideas" that come about due to collaboration within an organization.  
</p>

<h2>Suggestions to lead without formal authority</h2>
<p>
	Steven DeMaio gives several examples in the <a href="https://hbr.org/2009/05/leading-when-you-dont-have-for.html">Harvard Business Review article</a> of ways that he has been able to work in several different capacities on extending his leadership capacity to those he does not formally manage.
	<ul>
		<li><b>"Let your enthusiasm for the work be contagious.</b>
			<p>
				I have found in my experience that my enthusiasm for a project tends to draw people in and has people more likely to want to work with me.  I have noticed this trend since I was in sales:  if I was able to get excited about something (or at least sound like I was excited in front of a customer) they were much more likely to purchase and listen to my suggestion.  That is one simple way to lead people (to a decision) without really having any purchasing authority over their money.  It very much works that way during projects, too.  I have noticed a change in my team's motivation since I have been working on the projects with them because I am excited to be working with them and helping them make the best software possible for our customers.  
			</p>
		</li>
		<li><b>"Demonstrate excellence without being cocky or solicitous of approval.</b>
			<p>
				DeMaio ends this part with, "Needy leaders are rarely inspiring."  I think that is so true that when we look at true leaders, we generally are much more apt to following the servant leaders than the egotistical leaders.  DeMaio is saying that we need to show excellence in our work, but not be the type of leader that demands validation for her work or the one to take all of the credit for a team's success.  You do not have to be the master at what you do, but you do have to know how to succeed both with the technical work required and be successful with the softer skills of leading people.  
			</p>
		</li>
		<li><b>Don't be over-invested in outcomes</b>
			<p>
				It is better to be curious and inquisitive than one who could be seen as being watchful of the outcome.  I take this to mean that you care more for your people, you care more that the process is done right, than you care about a specific outcome being achieved.  
			</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h2>Six types of influence</h2>
<p>
	Jo Miller talks about the six different types of influence that someone can use in their workplace to create an impact on results, and ultimately lead without formal authority.  Those sources of influence are:
	<ul>
		<li><b>Positional influence</b>
			<p>
				
			</p>
		</li>
		<li><b>Expertise</b>
			<p>
				
			</p>
		</li>
		<li><b>Resource influence</b>
			<p>
				Basically, do you use your resources wisely.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li><b>Informational influence</b>
			<p>
				Do you know what is going on within your organization, are you seen as a source of knowledge. 
			</p>
		</li>
		<li><b>Direct influence</b>
			<p>
				Are you able to be firm, fair, and professional when someone behaves out of line.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li><b>Relationship influence</b>
			<p>
				Building good working relationships with people. 
			</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>
