<p>
	There are often times when a group must be led without anyone assigning (formal) authority to you.  What are the right ways to help lead or guide that group through a process or to make a decision.  Often, as a Business Analyst, you should be treated as a trusted advisor, whose opinion should be respected.  However, you may not be treated as such.  Here are some of the ways (though not always easy) that you can help to be seen as a leader and guide the team you are working with.
