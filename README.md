# BAtoolbox

This is for the evolving BA toolbox we are goign to be using for helping the teams remove roadblocks and get unstuck from their projects.

Layout will change as file count gets larger.  For right now, it will all be in the same directory.  I will update here as changes need to be made.

If you create or add anything to a file, please make sure that any and all references you use be documented at the bottom of each page in the following format:

<a>Lastname, Firstname - Page title</a> or
<a>Lastname, F. - Page title</a> or
<a>Main Website Title - Page title</a>

I would prefer to site the author/editor of the page first.  If that information is not availble, siting the website is ok.  And please alphabetize by last name, I know it may feel anal but it helps me find references faster.
