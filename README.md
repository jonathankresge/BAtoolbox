# BAtoolbox

This is for the evolving BA toolbox we are goign to be using for helping the teams remove roadblocks and get unstuck from their projects.

For now, the layout is going to be as follows:
*html, css, and image files should go in their own directory
*images should be named filename_section(#).*  If there are multiple images in the same section, the # indicates which one it is
*assets are everything else (pdf files, etc) that don't belong in one of the other directories.

If you create or add anything to a file, please make sure that any and all references you use be documented at the bottom of each page in the following format:

<a>Lastname, Firstname - Page title</a> or
<a>Lastname, F. - Page title</a> or
<a>Main Website Title - Page title</a>

I would prefer to site the author/editor of the page first.  If that information is not availble, siting the website is ok.  And please alphabetize by last name, I know it may feel anal but it helps me find references faster.
