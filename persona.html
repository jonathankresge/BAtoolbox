<h1>Who is this for?</h1>
<p>
	For teams who want to empathize with our users.  A persona (according to Wikipedia) is a "fictional character created to represent the differnet user types that might use a site, brand, or product in a similar way."  Developing and understanding personas are great ways to really get into the minds of our users for a project.  
</p>

<h1>Works best when...</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Creating personas before trying to create a solution to a problem.  It can help create better brainstorming activities, use case specification, and feature definition.</li>
	<li>Needing to have a consistent definition of your user to be shared among stakeholders</li>
	<li>Conceptualizing a set of real users' goals, capabilities, and contexts for using your product/service</li>
	<li>Keeping the conern on the main set of users and not the edge cases when designing a solution</li>
	<li>You have data on your users from which to base your personas.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Maybe not for you IF...</h1>
<ul>
	<li>You are creating these yourself, these should be created in groups to prefent "self-referential design"</li>
	<li>You are not willing to validate your assertions with data about your product or service</li>

</ul>

<h1>Who's involved?  How long?</h1>
<ul>
	<li>2-12 people, the larger the group the better</li>
	<li>A group that has the best understanding of the user</li>
	<li>1-2 hours</li>
</ul>

<h1>Materials you will need</h1>

<h1>Why personas?</h1>
<p>
	Personas will ive you a quick way to figure out what is challenging a specific user type, what their goals are, and how comfortable they are achieving their goals (or what they would need to feel comfortable achieving their goals).  Usability.gov gives the following key beneifts to using personas:
	<ul>
		<li>Stakeholders and leaders evaluate new feature ideas in terms of what will help the persona</li>
		<li>Information architects can develop informed wireframe, infervace behaviors, and labeling</li>
		<li>Designers create the look and feel with a specific user segment in mind</li>
		<li>Systems engineers/developer decide can which approach to take based on behaviors of user personas</li>
		<li>Content authors can ensure the site content is geared towards the right audiences</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h1>How to develop a persona?</h1>

<p>
	There will be three big things that we will want to answer in working on creating the persona.  The first is <em>What is the purpose of vision</em> of the product or service in question.  <em>Describe the user</em> on a personal, professional, and technical level.  Describe the <em>user's motivation and goals</em>.
</p>

<p>
	There are some best practices for creating personas:
	<ul>
		<li>Conduct your user research to answer who your users are; why they are using the system; and what their behaviors, assumptions, and expectations are for your system.</li>
		<li>Find themes in your research taht are specific, relevant, and universal to the users</li>
		<li>Organize the elements into persona groups that represent your target users</li>
		<li>Combine and prioritize the personas into primary, secondary, and, if necessary, users who you do not want using your system (anti-personas)</li>
		<li>Develop descriptions around them including a background, motivations, and expectations.  The best personas have a photograph to visually represent this persona.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
	Here are several elements that should a part of almost every persona:
	<ul>
		<li>Persona froup (example, web developer)</li>
		<li>Fictional name</li>
		<li>Job titles and major responsibilities</li>
		<li>Demographic information (age, education, ethnicity, family status)</li>
		<li>Their goals and tasks associated with using your product/service</li>
		<li>Their physical, social, and technological environment</li>
		<li>A quote that sums up what matters most to them, as it relates to your product or service</li>
	</ul>
</p>


<h2>Pitfalls to avoid</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Getting too specific with your persona could exclude larger portions of your user base</li>
</ul>

<h2>Helpful to understand</h2>

<h2>Big wins</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Your biggest win will come if you develop your persona at the beginning of a project.  This way the persona can influence the design and testing of the solution throughout implementationn.</li>
</ul>
