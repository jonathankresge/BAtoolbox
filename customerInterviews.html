<h1>Customer Interviews</h1>
<p>
	It is best to as open ended questions as much as possible, let the interviewee tell you as much as they can.  
</p>
<p>
	There is a debate on how many customers to interview for these processes, but generally anywhere from five to thirty participants should suffice.  The number isn't as big of a concern as being able to see a trend in the data you are getting.  Remember, we aren't tryign to go for statistical significance, we are simply trying to go for qualitative consensus.  You can generally start to see trends with just five people.  
</p>
<p>
	It is also generally a good idea to do interviews in pairs.  This gets two sets of ears on the interviewee.  It also allows one person to focus completely on asking the questions, and any followup questions that may be necessary, as well as have someone just taking notes the entire time.  This way, neither person is distracted from their job.
