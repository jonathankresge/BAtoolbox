<h1>What is this?</h1>

I have put together this set of tools to help teams get unstuck when problems arise.  I will start out with just a few tools that I will have detailed and I will be adding to them weekly.  

<h2>Current tools in the toolbox</h2>

<p>
	All the tools in the toolbox will require an impartial facilitator to run the activities, unless otherwise stated.  I will list the average time it takes to use the tools next to the name below, but keep in mind that assumes that the group stays on task and the group has some experience with these tools in the past.  If either of these is lacking, please add extra time.  Also, if you would like a Business Analyst (BA) to facilitate the meeting for you, please just sent me a message with the details and I will try to arrange a time that works for everyone.
